              <p>There are some items to note before we dive into our analysis, all of which ties into latitude.</p> 
              <p>The first thing to note is we have Artic and Antarctic zones that are between 66.5° and 90° N&S (https://courses.botany.wisc.edu/botany_422/Lecture/pdf/Climate1.pdf). Here we have a number of factors that comes into play such as:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Prolonged lengths of days and nights (6 months each).</li>
                      <li>Lack of vegetation.</li>

                  </ul>

                All of these factors show characteristics in varying weather patterns.</p>
                <p>The second fact to note is the globe rotates around the sun on a tilt. This means that in early months, northern hemisphere will show higher temperatures than southern hemisphere and in later months, the southern hemisphere will see higher temperatures (summer) while the northern hemisphere will have colder temperatures (winter).</p>

                      <div id="compare">
                        <img src="Picture3.jpg"
                        width=70%
                        height=70%
                        >
                      </div>

                <p>Lastly, it is important to note that there is significantly more land mass in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere. This leads to a higher population, which in turn means there are more datapoints to accurately capture weather items such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. </p>
